## Purposly: Calendar With A Purpose

Want to contribute to your community, while spending your time efficiently? Our calendar app will predict the times you are available and suggest local, relevant volunteer opportunities.

New to the city? Purposly will show you fun cultural events and festivals you can attend, so that you can be a part of the Montreal community.

Purposly is a prototype created for the AI for Social Good hackathon in Montreal.

## Technical Features

We merged several data sets of cultural and volunteer opportunities, appending geolocated data. The web app asks for your name, age, preferred transportation mode, and location in order to recommend events. Over time, it will refine its recommendations based on previous users' choices (feature not yet built).

The calendar uses a formula to predict the probability that you are not busy, based on previous input.

## Lessons Learned

As a team without existing AI skills, we relied on our experience using Javascript, Python, and R. We spent a lot of time reviewing Montreal's open data sets and other repositories. We ran regressions to predict user relevance based on previous data. We also read about machine learning tools. Most of all, we had fun learning about the possibilities of AI for social good!
